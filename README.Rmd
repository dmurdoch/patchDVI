# patchDVI

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of patchDVI is to support previewer forward and reverse search between Sweave, knitr or R Markdown 
source and .dvi, .pdf or .html output.

This project was originally hosted on R-forge; see

  https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/sweavesearch/
  
for the older history.

## Installation

This version of `patchDVI` makes use of some functions that
will be released in R 4.3.0.  They are available in a development
version of the `backports` package.

It also requires patches to `knitr` to support concordances in
R Markdown files.  These are also currently in a development version 
of that package.

You can install the development version of `patchDVI` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmurdoch/backports")
devtools::install_github("dmurdoch/knitr")
devtools::install_github("dmurdoch/patchDVI")
```

## Usage

See the [`patchDVI` vignette](https://dmurdoch.github.io/patchDVI/articles/patchDVI.html) for usage details and history.
